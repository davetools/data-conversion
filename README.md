# EBCDIC to ASCII file Conversion with Packed Decimal Field handling

This is my simple VBA-based project to convert large EBCDIC files to ASCII format. This includes support for EBCDIC files that include standard Packed Decimal fields. Community involvement is appreciated to expand on my code to support various other EBCDIC field types, adding functionality for auto-detection of record length, and other contributions to make the conversion more comprehensive and robust.

This project was driven by the need for me to be able to readily convert large amounts of data extracted from mainframe systems (in EBCDIC) for subsequent import into modern database systems.

I will include an example stand-alone tool that I put together in Microsoft Access to demonstrate how the code can be used very easily. This code could also relatively easily be used in Microsoft Excel.
